# ALG2-TP2
UFMG DCC207 - Assignment 2

This project is about the binary knapsack problem, which is NP-hard.
Two different approaches were tried to solve it, namely backtracking and branch-and-bound.

The source code is just the interface to handle input, and then the algorithm itself.

The results, with the time taken to compute each entry for each algorithm
in a Google Colab environment, can be found in the folder tests-out.
